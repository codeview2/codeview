C++ programs for accelerated Proximal Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent with L1-L2 regularization

-----------
1. Introduction
This software package provides a sample implementation of accelerated Proximal Stochastic DualCoordinate Ascent 
(prox-SDCA) with L1-L2 regularization described in [1] for various loss functions.  

API Documentation in html/index.html

-----------
2. System Requirement
The code is tested on Linux, but should compile on other unix systems
with g++ and make. 

-----------
3. Building the executables
Go to the src/ subdirectory and type 
make

This should generate the following executables 
train (for training) 
predict (for prediction)

-----------
5. Test
Go to the exp/ subdirectory and type run

----------
6. Help

Use train -h to see command line options for the training program
Use predict -h to see command line options for the prediction program
